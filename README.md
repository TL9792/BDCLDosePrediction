# BDCLDosePrediction
The implementation of the paper "Beam-wise Dose Composition Learning for Head and Neck Cancer Dose Prediction in Radiotherapy" in Pytorch.
## Performance
* The comparison result of dose distribution map with state-of-the-art methods.

* The quantitative result in terms of two official metrics from the [AAMP OpenKBP-2020 Challenge](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/23428#results), i.e., Dose score and DVH score. Our method achieves superior performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods. 
* The reproduction results may have certain deviations due to different GPUs used. 

Dose score  |  DVH score    
----  |  ----
2.066±0.900  |  0.977±1.091
